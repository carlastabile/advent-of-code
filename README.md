# Advent of Code  

First time ever doing an advent of code was 2020. Initially I started using python3 but then switched to ruby because ruby is life. 

For 2021 I'll try again with python3! Fingers crossed 🤞🏼

Each folder contains a year and each year the challenge of a day and my answer. 

I usually start with a naive answer and try to iterate over it to improve. Nonetheless, I can't promess I iterated over all of them :D 

## Contribute 
I feel fancy, but if you want to contribute by improving my answers please feel fre to open a PR. What's a GitHub repo without PRs am I right?

## Be nice
